## Introduction

Welcome to the Machine Learning and Data Analysis Repository! This repository is a compilation of Jupyter Notebooks covering various topics, including machine learning models, data analysis techniques, and Python tutorials. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn or an experienced practitioner seeking reference materials, you'll find something useful here.

## Files

### 1. Happy Employee.ipynb

The "Happy Employee" notebook explores employee satisfaction and turnover using a dataset with the following key columns:

- `satisfaction_level`: Employee satisfaction level.
- `last_evaluation`: Last performance evaluation score.
- `number_project`: Number of projects the employee has worked on.
- `average_montly_hours`: Average monthly working hours.
- `time_spend_company`: Number of years spent at the company.
- `Work_accident`: Binary indicator of whether the employee has had a work accident.
- `promotion_last_5years`: Binary indicator of whether the employee was promoted in the last 5 years.
- `sales`: Department in which the employee works.
- `left`: Binary indicator of employee turnover (1 for turnover, 0 for no turnover).

The notebook utilizes these columns to conduct a detailed analysis of employee satisfaction, identifying factors that may contribute to turnover. Various data exploration and visualization techniques are employed to gain insights into the workforce, helping organizations understand and potentially mitigate employee turnover.

Feel free to run the notebook and explore the findings to gain valuable insights into employee satisfaction and retention.
